    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>"Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability to define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. This allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different signatures, while method overriding enables a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class. 
        This concept is fundamental to object-oriented programming and allows for more flexible and modular code design"</p>
